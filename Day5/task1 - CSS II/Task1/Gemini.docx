Task 1: CSS Processor

A CSS processor is a tool that extends the functionality of CSS, allowing developers to write more efficient, maintainable, and feature-rich stylesheets. It pre-processes CSS code into regular CSS that browsers can understand.

Popular CSS preprocessors:

- Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets): Offers features like nesting, variables, functions, mixins, and more.
- LESS (Leaner Style Sheets): Provides similar features to Sass, including variables, mixins, operations, and nesting.
Advantages of using a CSS processor:

- Improved code organization: Nesting and partials help structure CSS.
- Increased code reusability: Variables, mixins, and functions promote code reuse.
- Enhanced maintainability: Easier to update and manage styles.
- Faster development: Less repetitive code and quicker style changes.
Example of Sass simplifying CSS:

// Sass code
$primary-color: #007bff;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
