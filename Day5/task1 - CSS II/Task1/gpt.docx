Task 1: CSS Processor

A CSS processor is a tool that extends CSS with programming-like capabilities. 
It adds features such as variables, nested rules, functions, and mixins, allowing developers to write cleaner, reusable, and more maintainable CSS code. 
The processor then compiles this enhanced code into standard CSS for browsers.
Examples of Popular CSS Preprocessors
      1. Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
      2. LESS (Leaner Style Sheets)
      3. Stylus
Advantages of Using a CSS Processor
      - Code Reusability: Define reusable styles and use them across different components.
      - Readability: Nested rules and variables improve the readability of CSS.
      - Scalability: Easier to manage large projects with partials and imports.
      - Consistency: Variables ensure consistent styling throughout.
Example: Sass Code vs. CSS Output
Sass Code
$primary-color: #3498db;

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: $primary-color;

  .header {
    padding: 10px;
    color: white;
  }

  .content {
    margin: 20px;
    color: darken($primary-color, 20%);
  }
}

Compiled CSS Output 
 
 body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #3498db;
}

body .header {
  padding: 10px;
  color: white;
}

body .content {
  margin: 20px;
  color: #2a7abf;
}
