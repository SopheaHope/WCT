Task 5: Style on HTML

Inline Styles: Styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.
Example:
HTML
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a paragraph with inline styles.</p>

+ Pros and Cons:
      - Pros: Easy to apply specific styles to individual elements.
      - Cons: Can clutter HTML code, makes maintenance difficult, and violates separation of concerns.
