 4: How to Debug CSS
Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and view applied styles:

      1. Right-click an element and select Inspect.
      2. View Styles to see applied CSS and identify issues.
      3. Test CSS changes live in the Styles pane.
Example: If a color is not appearing as expected, check the Specificity or Cascade Order in the developer tools to resolve conflicting styles.
