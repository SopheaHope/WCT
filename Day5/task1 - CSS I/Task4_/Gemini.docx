Task 4: How to Debug CSS

 + Common Issues and Debugging:
      - Missing or incorrect selectors: Check for typos and ensure selectors match the correct elements.
      - Conflicting styles: Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and identify conflicting styles.
      - Specificity issues: Understand CSS specificity rules to determine which styles take precedence.
 + Step-by-Step Guide:
      1. Open the web page in a browser.
      2. Right-click on an element and select "Inspect" (or use the developer tools shortcut).
      3. Examine the element's style properties in the inspector.
      4. Identify any conflicting or incorrect styles.
      5. Modify the CSS code and refresh the page to see the changes.
 - Example: If a paragraph element is not displaying correctly, inspect its styles in the developer tools to check for conflicting font-family or color properties.
